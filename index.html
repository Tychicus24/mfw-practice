  <h1>My First MFW Homework Assignment, Bootstrap Page</h1>
  </div>
  
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Who Am I</I></h3>
      <p>Hello Jacque, my name is James Michael McCullough, I go by Mike though</p>
      </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Why I'm Here</h3>
      <p>I will be 62 in April. I used to work for an Architect as a Construction Manager. I had several brain injuries over the last few years and am no longer able to do what I used to. I have always had an interest in computers and technology and would have went in to programming when I was young if it had been a normal career path then.  I am hoping to come away from these classes with a new career.</p>

      <h3>What's Next</h3>        
      <p> It took quite a bit of work to get the homework done but here it is. I look forward to this class, thank you for all your help so far, see you tonight</p>
